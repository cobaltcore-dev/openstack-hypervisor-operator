# openstack-hypervisor-operator
Kubernetes operator to manage and automate the lifecycle of KVM hypervisor nodes within an OpenStack environment.

## Description
The OpenStack Hypervisor Operator is a Kubernetes operator designed to manage and automate
the lifecycle of KVM hypervisor nodes within an OpenStack environment. This operator listens for Eviction requests
within the Kubernetes cluster and initiates the evacuation of virtual machines (VMs) from the specified hypervisor
nodes by interacting with the OpenStack API. By leveraging this operator, administrators can ensure seamless and
automated handling of hypervisor node maintenance, upgrades, and failure recovery, thereby enhancing the overall
reliability and efficiency of the OpenStack infrastructure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.22.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/openstack-hypervisor-operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

#### Installation via *kustomize*

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/openstack-hypervisor-operator:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

#### Installation via *Helm*

Install CRDs and Controller

```sh
helm upgrade --install openstack-hypervisor-operator charts/openstack-hypervisor-operator
```

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall


#### via *kustomize*

**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

#### via *Helm*

```sh
helm delete kvm-node-agent
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/openstack-hypervisor-operator:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/openstack-hypervisor-operator/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```
